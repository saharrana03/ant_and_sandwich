Ant and Sandwich: A Statistical and Machine Learning Analysis

This mini project investigates how specific sandwich ingredients—bread type, topping, and the presence of butter—influence the number of ants attracted. The dataset consists of recorded ant counts for various sandwich configurations and serves as a foundation for both statistical evaluation and predictive modeling.

The analysis combines classical statistical techniques with modern machine learning to extract actionable insights:

Descriptive statistics and visualizations to explore distribution patterns

Inferential testing using ANOVA, Tukey's HSD, and Hedges' g to assess significant effects and effect sizes

Predictive modeling via Random Forest regression to identify key features

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values for interpreting model outputs and understanding feature contributions

This mini project exemplifies an end-to-end analytical pipeline, from hypothesis-driven exploration to model interpretation, offering a clear example of how statistical reasoning and machine learning can work hand-in-hand to uncover behavioral patterns.
